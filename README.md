# **ELABorate**
ELABorate is a Circuit Analysis Tool capable of pure symbolic analysis, as well as partial or complete numerical evaluation. Written and run in MATLAB. ELABorate is geared towards circuit analysis and design, but has applications for any general system analysis, such as controller design.
