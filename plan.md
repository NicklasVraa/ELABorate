# Plan
Report:
- Add examples from Linear Circuits p.554-557, p.615, p.622.
- Add examples from Microelectronic Circuits p.390, p.410, p.425, p.468.
- Add t-model, h-param and y-param, z-param, and s-param to future additions.

Code:
- Add general impedance class.
- Implement high-frequency-hybrid-pi modelling.
- Implement assumptions and subsequent simplification.
- Input- and output resistances.
- Thevenin/Norton equivalent output.

Graphical output:
- All sources
