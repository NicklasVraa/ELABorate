### **Project Plans**
This is an overview of the plans for ELABorate. It is very much subject to change.

**Electrical circuits:**
- Supporting non-linear elements. **(WIP)**
- Built-in validation/debugging of netlist input.
- Finding circuit stability factors.
- Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuit.
- Identify sub-circuit patterns, such as amplifiers.
- Stringing sub-circuits together.
- Output circuit netlist, based on desired circuit behaviour.
- Drawing circuits from netlists.
- Extracting netlist from image, using computer vision.

**Control Systems:**
- Routh's stability criterion.
- Nyquist rate.
